## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Batch-Wise Materials**:  
   If you want to contribute materials, organize them in a batch-wise manner.  
   For example:
   - If you're from the **2023-2025 batch** and have a PDF for the 2nd semester:
        - Navigate to the folder named `sem 2nd` (create it if it doesnâ€™t exist).
        - Inside `sem 2nd`, create a folder named `2023-2025` (if it doesnâ€™t already exist).
        - Add your materials in the appropriate subfolder.
        - e.g. 
                sem 2nd/
                    â””â”€â”€ 2023-2025/
                        â”œâ”€â”€ 1. OOP with JAVA/
                              â”œâ”€â”€ Notes.pdf
                    

2. **Exam Papers**:  
   Previous year question papers (PYQs) are not categorized by batches.  
   Simply place them in the `Exam Papers` folder under the respective semester.
